## タイトル
On Auslander-Reiten Heller components for symmetric orders
## アブストラクト
The notion of almost split sequences was introduced by M. Auslander and I. Reiten around 1970, and they showed the existence of almost split sequences for Artin algebras. We often use the theory to analyze various additive categories arising from representation theory and prove many important combinatorial and homological properties with the help of the theory. A combinatorial skeleton of the additive category of indecomposable objects is the Auslander–Reiten quiver, which encapsulates much information on indecomposable objects and irreducible morphisms. Therefore, to determine the shapes of Auslander–Reiten quivers is one of classical problems in representation theory of algebras. For a symmetric order over a complete discrete valuation ring, the stable Auslandr-Reiten quiver is obtained by deleting proj-inj vertices from the Auslander-Reiten quiver. When the order is not an isolated singularity, the shapes of the stable Auslander-Reiten components are mostly unknown. In this talk, we will give a restriction on the shapes of the stable Auslander-Reiten components and give examples of the stable Auslander-Reiten components by focusing on Heller lattices.
