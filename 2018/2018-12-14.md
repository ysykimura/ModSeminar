## タイトル
Nakashima-Zelevinsky polytopes from convex-geometric Demazure operators
## アブストラクト
A Nakashima-Zelevinsky polytope is a rational convex polytope whose lattice points give a polyhedral realization of a highest weight crystal basis. This is also identical to a Newton-Okounkov body of a flag variety, and it induces a toric degeneration. In this talk, we give a new construction of a specific class of Nakashima-Zelevinsky polytopes by using Kiritchenko's Demazure operators on polytopes. From this construction, we see that polytopes in this class have the additivity with respect to the Minkowski sum. We also give a geometric application to the normal toric variety associated with a Nakashima-Zelevinsky polytope.
