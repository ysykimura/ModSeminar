## Title
Algebras that admit n-cluster tilting subcategories
## Abstract
In higher dimensional Auslander-Reiten theory one replaces the module category of an associative algebra by a subcategory with suitable homological properties. The most standard choice is to consider a so-called n-cluster tilting subcategory. A fundamental question is therefore: which algebras admit an n-cluster tilting subcategory of their module category? Although a definitive answer to this question seems to much to hope for, there are several results on how to obtain such algebras. In my talk I will give a survey of these results with a focus on algebras where an n-cluster tilting subcategory can be described explicitly.
