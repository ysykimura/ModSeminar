## タイトル
Cluster realizations of Weyl groups and their application
## アブストラクト
Cluster algebras are commutative algebras which are determined from combinatorial data represented by weighted quivers. These combinatorial data are used for successive construction, called mutation, of algebra generators. A cluster modular group is the group consisting of automorphisms of a cluster algebra which are given by mutation sequences preserving a given weighted quiver. In this talk, we realize the Weyl groups associated with symmetrizable Kac-Moody Lie algebras as subgroups of cluster modular groups. We explain application of our construction of Weyl groups : An algebraic application is a systematic construction of green sequences associated with reduced words of elements of the Weyl group. In particular, if a given Kac-Moody Lie algebra is of finite type, then reduced words of the longest element give the maximal green sequences (and the cluster Donaldson-Thomas transformation) associated to our weighted quiver. As a geometric application, we discuss the comparison between our realization of the Weyl group and a geometric action of the Weyl group on the moduli space of twisted decorated $G$-local systems on a marked surface, which is known to be a cluster variety. This talk is based on a joint work with Rei Inoue and Tsukasa Ishibashi.
