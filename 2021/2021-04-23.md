Intervals of s-torsion pairs in extriangulated categories with negative first extensions
    
## アブストラクト
In a triangulated category, Happel, Reiten and Smalo provided a construction of new t-structures through torsion pairs in the heart of a given t-structure. This construction induces a bijection between the set of certain t-structures and the set of torsion pairs in the heart. On the other hand, Asai--Pfeifer and Tattar established a bijection for torsion pairs in an abelian category, which is related to tau-tilting theory. In this talk, we introduce the notion of s-torsion pairs in an extriangulated category as a common generalization of t-structures and torsion pairs (in abelian/exact categories). Moreover, we establish a bijection for s-torsion pairs in an extriangulated category which unifies two bijections above. This talk is based on a joint work with Takahide Adachi and Haruhisa Enomoto.
