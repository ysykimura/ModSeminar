## タイトル
On the module categories of preprojective algebras with symmetrizers
## アブストラクト
In some contexts of representation theories, some quivers with relations have been expected to characterize representation theories associated with non-symply laced Dynkin diagrams. From this viewpoint, Geiss-Leclerc-Schr\"oer has introduced some algebras associated with symmetrizable generalized Cartan matrices and its symmetrizers as quivers with relations (That is, a kind of 1-Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebras and its preprojective algebras). In this talk, we review the definitions and basic properties of them. Then, I will explain some structures of module categories of the preprojective algebras from a viewpoint of tilting theory.
