## タイトル
Wide subcategories and lattices of torsion classes
## アブストラクト
This talk is based on joint work with Calvin Pfeifer (Bonn). For a fixed abelian length category A, the poset tors A of torsion classes in A is a lattice. Any interval [U,T] in tors A is a sublattice of tors A, and the difference between the two torsion classes U and T is described by the subcategory W:=U^⊥∩T. Motivated by τ-tilting reduction of Jasso, we mainly studied the case that W is a wide subcategory of A; such [U,T] are called wide intervals. In this talk, I will explain our main result that a wide interval [U,T] is isomorphic to the lattice tors W of torsion classes in the abelian category W. Also, I would like to talk about several characterizations of wide intervals obtained in our work.
