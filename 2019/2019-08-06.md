Yangian presentations associated to Lie algebras in classical types
## アブストラクト
Yangians are introduced by Drinfeld as one of the two main classes of quantum groups. Drinfeld later gave new realization of the Yangian associated with the general linear Lie algebra in 1985, proved by Brundan-Kleshchev in 2005. In this talk we will discuss the recent solution of identifying the Yangian in types BCD between the RTT formulism and the Drinfeld realization. This is joint work with Ming Liu and Alexander Molev.
