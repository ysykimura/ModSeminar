Singularities of R-matrices, graded quiver varieties and generalized quantum affine Schur-Weyl duality
    
## アブストラクト
The R-matrices are realized as intertwining operators between tensor products of two finite-dimensional simple modules of the quantum affine algebras. They can be seen as matrix-valued rational functions in spectral parameters, whose singularities strongly reflect the structure of tensor product modules. In this talk, we present a simple unified formula expressing the denominators of the R-matrices between the fundamental modules of type ADE and explain its relation to the representation theory of the Dynkin quivers / the geometry of Nakajima's graded quiver varieties. As an application, we obtain a geometric interpretation of Kang-Kashiwara-Kim's generalized quantum affine Schur-Weyl duality functor when it arises from a family of fundamental modules. Such a geometric interpretation sometimes provides an efficient way to understand the monoidal structure of the module category of the quantum affine algebras.
