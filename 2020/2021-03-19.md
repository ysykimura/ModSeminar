## Title
Equivalence via generalized quantum affine Schur-Weyl duality
    
## Abstract
In this talk, we show in full generality that the generalized quantum affine Schur-Weyl duality functor, introduced by Kang-Kashiwara-Kim, gives an equivalence between the category of finite-dimensional modules over a quiver-Hecke algebra and a certain full subcategory of finite-dimensional modules over a quantum affine algebra which is a generalization of a Hernandez-Leclerc's category.  

In untwisted ADE types, this was previously proved by Ryo Fujita using the geometric representation theory on quiver varieties, which is not applicable in general types. In our approach, we study a certain endomorphism ring of a bimodule appearing in the construction of the generalized quantum affine Schur-Weyl duality functor. This is purely algebraic, and hence can be extended uniformly to general types.
