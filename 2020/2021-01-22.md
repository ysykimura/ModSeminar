## Title
Super duality for quantum affine algebras of type A
    
## Abstract
We introduce a new approach to study finite-dimensional representations of the quantum group of the affine Lie superalgebra L(gl_{M|N}) (M≠N). More precisely, there exists an exact monoidal functor called truncation, which gives an equivalence of categories between certain subcategory of modules over the generalized quantum groups introduced by [Kuniba-Okado-Sergeev 15], and a subcategory of those over the quantum affine algebra of type A. The key observation is that spectral decompositions of R-matrices coincide, so that the construction of the generalized quantum affine Schur-Weyl duality functor by [Kang-Kashiwara-Kim 18] works equally well in either case. The result can be viewed as an affine analogue of super duality of type A. This talk is based on a joint work ([arXiv:2010.06508](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06508)) with Jae-Hoon Kwon.
