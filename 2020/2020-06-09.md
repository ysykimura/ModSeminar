Algebraic entropy of sign-stable mutation loops
    
## アブストラクト
A mutation loop is a certain equivalence class of a sequence of mutations and permutations of indices. They form a group called the cluster modular group, which can be regarded as a combinatorial generalization of the mapping class groups of marked surfaces. We introduce a new property of mutation loops which we call the “sign stability” as a generalization of the pseudo-Anosov property of a mapping class. A sign-stable mutation loop has a numerical invariant which we call the “cluster stretch factor”, in analogy with the stretch factor of a pA mapping class. We compute the algebraic entropies of the cluster A- and X-transformations induced by a sign-stable mutation loop, and conclude that these two are estimated by the logarithm of the cluster stretch factor. This talk is based on a joint work with Shunsuke Kano.
